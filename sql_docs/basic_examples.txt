# Example Prompts and Calculations for basic aggregations
## Basic Measure aggregations
### Prompt: "Compare the total {measure} between {category1} and {category2} over the past {time_period}."
```sql
SELECT 
    {category},
    DATEDIFF(MAX(date), DATE_SUB(MAX(date), INTERVAL {time_period})) / 7 AS Interval_Weeks, 
    SUM({measure} * gweight) AS total_{measure}
FROM purchase
WHERE {category} IN ('{category1}', '{category2}')
  AND date >= (SELECT DATE_SUB(MAX(date), INTERVAL {time_period}) FROM purchase)
GROUP BY {category};```

### Prompt: "What are the highest {categories} in terms of {measure} over the past {time_period}?
```sql
SELECT 
    {category},
    DATEDIFF(MAX(date), DATE_SUB(MAX(date), INTERVAL {time_period})) / 7 AS Interval_Weeks, 
    SUM({measure} * gweight) AS total_{measure}
  FROM purchase
  GROUP BY {category}
  WHERE date >= (SELECT DATE_SUB(MAX(date), INTERVAL {time_period}) FROM purchase)
  ORDER BY total_{measure} DESC
  LIMIT 5;```

### Prompt: "Compare the total {measure} between {category1} and {category2} since {date}."
```sql
SELECT 
    {category},
    SUM({measure} * gweight) AS total_{measure}
  FROM purchase
  WHERE {category} IN ('{category1}', '{category2}')
  AND date >= DATE '{date}'
  GROUP BY {category};```

### Prompt: "Which {category} has the highest {measure}, {category1},{category2} or {category3} over the past {time_period}?
```sql
SELECT 
    {category},
    SUM({measure} * gweight) AS total_{measure}
  FROM purchase
  WHERE {category} IN ({category1},{category2},{category3})
  AND date >= (SELECT DATE_SUB(MAX(date), INTERVAL {time_period}) FROM purchase)
  GROUP BY {category}
  ORDER BY total_{measure} DESC```
